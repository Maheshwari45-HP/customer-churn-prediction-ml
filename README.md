# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company using machine learning techniques.  
The dataset contains 7,043 customer records with information such as demographics, tenure, subscription services, and status (joined, stayed, or churned).  

The goal is to predict whether a customer will stay, join, or churn based on these parameters.

## 📓 Model Performance  

| Machine Learning Model | Accuracy |
|-------------------------|----------|
| Random Forest           | 78.11%   |
| Logistic Regression     | 78.28%   |
| Decision Tree           | 77.29%   |
| Naive Bayes (Gaussian)  | 36.77%   |
| XGBoost Classifier      | 80.86%   |

XGBoost outperformed all other models and was chosen as the best solution.  


## 🚀 Business Impact  
Predicting churn helps companies:  
- Proactively engage high-risk customers with support  
- Target retention campaigns for at-risk groups  
- Reduce churn rate and improve customer lifetime value  

In short: Better churn prediction = stronger customer retention = higher revenue.
